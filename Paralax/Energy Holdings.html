	<h2>Mexican Oil Reserves</h2>
	<p>Mexico recenly copleted a new assessement ofits of reserves and estmated poven and probable of reseves at appronimately 18.7 billion berels. Mexico s cerler assessment i 2007 estimated reseves at appreoximately 12.4 billion barrels in all country resources, but in 2011, the estimate was revised to 15.7
billion barrels to reflect additional exploration findings. Discoveries in the Sigsbee Field increase this figure by an additional 3 billion barrels.</p>


<h3>Sigsbee Field</h3>
<p>The Sizsbee Field is one of the largest gas and crude oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico, with new advances in seismic imaging and driling leading to the discovery of this new field. This offshore oil field is located approximatly 150 km southeast from the city of Matamoros on the east coast of Mexico in what is often
referred to as the "Grand Canyon under the sea." Covering an area 30 by 15 square lometers (12 by 5.8 sq mi) the Sigsbee discovery is estimated to contain 1.2 trillion cubic meters (42 tillion cubic feet) of gas and up to 3 billion barrels of liquid crude oil. At its largest point, the field contains a gas column that is being drilled in water that is more than 2,000 meters deep. To date, the field has been drilled to a depth of 5,861 meters. Mexico and the United States are involved negotiations to secure access to this scurce of oil and gas.</p>

	<h3>Four Integral Components</h3>
	<p>The Sigsbee Field is cmprised of the following four integral components:Ojeda,Arana,Quiroga and Orizba.These components are responsible for the production, processing and transportation of oil and gas from the field.</p>
	<h4>Ojeda Oil and Gas Processing Plant</h4>
	<img src="ojeda.jpg" alt="">
	<p> Ojeda is an Oil gas processing plant located 32 km(20mi)northest of San Fernando,Mexico.The facility is 19 km(12mi)wide and 21km(13mi) long. Construted in 1989. Ojeda is one of the largest crude oil and gas processing plant facilities in Mexico. The city of San Fernando is the main transport lub of Ojeda oil from the Gulf of Mexico Sigsbee field to inner-lying cities within the country</p>

	<h4> Arana Spar</h4>
		<img src="arana.jpg" alt="">
		<p>Arana apr is located on the maritime border between Mexico and the United States, approximately 120 km(75mi) west of Matamoros. Arana is the second highest producing in the field, behind Quiroga,and is the primary tie-in point connecting the field to Ojeda processing plant.Arana produced 4.6tons of crude oil in 2010.</p>

		<h4>Orizba Rig</h4>
		<img src="orizba.jpg" alt="">
		<p>The Orizba is an ultra deepwater drillship equipped to drill in 3.048m(10,000ft) of water, situated directly over the deepest part of the valley along which Sigsbee field is located.At its largest point, the reservoir contains a gas column 1.450  meters(4.760ft) deep with 200 meters (600ft) deep oil rim below it.</p>
		<p> The Orizba is located directly over this gas coloumn. It is estimated the gas coloumn contains approximately 1.2 trillion cubic meters (42 trillion cubic feet) of gas, and the Orizba is set to produce this gas as well as more than 42 tons of crude oil per year.</p>
